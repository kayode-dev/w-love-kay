            First off, I'm sorry i couldn't put something down for everyone that
            came to mind, writing that many "heartfelt" messages is emotionally
            tasking and I'm quite lazy so you get the gist, regardless i have
            nothing but gratitude and thanks for everyone everywhere reading
            this right now, we might not be in constant commuication, but best
            believe I may or may not have your best interest at heart, but I
            most likely do.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is going to be the last cheezy thing I do for a while and it
            will take some more intense character development to trigger
            something like this again but before i close for the year, i'd like
            to go on one final rant where I just talk and you help me make sense
            of it, you know, just like the old blog.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm not one to normally reflect on the entire year and what it has
            and hasn't been, I just move on to the next without anything like
            goals or a plan per say, you do that for a couple of years without
            any substantial growth or change and it really does some damage to
            your ego, so you think "maybe it is time to do something different",
            as the popular saying goes{" "}
            <i>
              "doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different
              results is sick"
            </i>{" "}
            or something to that effect. A big part of me wishes i approached
            this year differently with more... "structure" or guidance -
            something just put in place to show me HOW and a much smaller part
            of me is trying it's very best to be appreciative of what I have
            acheived this year and the ones before, I am trying to express the
            latter more and hence this entire initative.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With time I've been able to understand that we all are combinations
            of our own innate characteristics / habits / qualities and the
            desirable habit / qualities of those closer to ourselves or people
            we admire and we sometimes channel these people when we find
            ourselves in situations that they thrive in, it's like switching
            persona's till it feels natural and you make it your own thing.
            There's a lot of micro processes that goes into just existing even
            if you feel like you're doing the bare minimum.
          </p>
          <br />

            This year I was opportune to experience very extreme emotions, some
            new, some nostalgic and some a painful reminder of what was and what
            could have been. I really do have some of the best people around me,
            thank you for being patient with me whilst i was going through it
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So lets get right into it... I guess, most of this is definitely not
            going to make the most amount of sense... to me at least, it's just
            a cute litte ramble about what is.
          </p>

            Optimism is something, a concept alike to faith, in the things
            yet to happen and with no gurantee that they will happen, our
            ability to dream and ideate creates this space in our minds where
            the end results exists and for a moment, it could feel like reality,
            like it happened and nothing could possibly go wrong.... until it
            does. Navigating through disappointment can be tasking, human nature
            would suggest you feel a certain and if you're like me, confusion
            sets in because you can't exactly discern / decide what you want to
            allow yourself feel. it's not the worst thing in the world to allow
            human nature take it's course, you are not a robot. Knowing where to
            draw the line and make effort to be better before you are consumed
            by whatever emotions you are subject to is what we.. I need to get
            the hand of. No one, not your friends or family are responsible for
            your happiness, it's a choice and at the end of the day it depends
            on if you allow it or not.

            That is honestly all the rambling I can do at this time and on that
            note I say thank you for being you, till I have a reason to do this
            again. This was really fun to make. Regret is stronger than
            gratitude, express your version of love and don't waste your time
            trying to be the main character in another person's story, it's
            giving insecure. I wanted to create a playlist for this cause, or I
            did create a playlist but that felt a bit too much on top of too
            much, Adieu
